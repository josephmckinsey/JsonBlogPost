The text does not accomplish its intended function. A Lean user in a hurry would struggle to determine that `json-schema-json` (or `json-schema-lean`) is production ready, and the text contains multiple sections that actively undermine this message.

**Critical Issues:**

TEXT: "Type-safe JSON in Lean" [title]
ISSUE: The title doesn't mention production readiness or the library name (`json-schema-json`/`json-schema-lean`), so a hurried reader won't know what this post is announcing.

TEXT: "I wanted to explore using Vega-Lite for plotting in Lean, and I wanted to have some sort of check. So in one giant PR, I mostly finished the json-schema-lean library"
ISSUE: "mostly finished" does not communicate "production ready" - it suggests incomplete work. A hurried reader needs a clear statement of readiness.

TEXT: "Skip to {ref plot}[the end] to see usage."
ISSUE: Telling a hurried reader to skip to the end indicates the opening doesn't serve their needs - it should state production readiness immediately.

TEXT: "I became dissatisfied with how JSON Schema code generation produces unergonomic types... Meanwhile, most languages don't track runtime validation..."
ISSUE: This paragraph discusses dissatisfaction and explores alternative approaches, suggesting the main library is inadequate. This contradicts a production-ready message.

TEXT: Entire "Step 1: JSON Schema in Lean" section
ISSUE: This development narrative (how features were implemented, what was difficult) doesn't inform a hurried reader about current production status or capabilities.

TEXT: "Despite dependent typing being really great since you can prove theorems, it's not ideal for things like plotting libraries."
ISSUE: Highlighting where the approach is "not ideal" undermines production readiness for a hurried reader who needs to know what works well now.

TEXT: "Luckily there was already a `json-schema-lean` library--a GSoC 2024 project. The main branch was incomplete"
ISSUE: Mentioning the library was incomplete without clearly stating it's now complete creates doubt about production status.

TEXT: "I discovered that there were a lot of features I never use nor want to"
ISSUE: This suggests the library includes unwanted complexity, which doesn't support a production-ready message.

TEXT: Entire "Step 1.1: URIs" section (and subsections)
ISSUE: This extended tangent about implementing a URI library doesn't inform the reader about json-schema production readiness.

TEXT: "## What doesn't work? Several Bowtie tests require you to read referenced JSON schemas on the fly from a URL. Lean does not have a good URL library, so I just decided to give up on that part."
ISSUE: A section titled "What doesn't work?" followed by describing abandoned features directly contradicts "production ready" for a hurried reader.

TEXT: "## Step 3: Code Gen with Vega-Lite - How did code gen work with Vega-Lite? • Mutual induction is still broken, oops? • It would take several minutes to compile, and it's >15,000 lines. • All the code is too ugly to use."
ISSUE: "still broken" and "too ugly to use" explicitly state the feature doesn't work well, contradicting production readiness.

TEXT: "# Back to the drawing board"
ISSUE: This entire section heading suggests starting over because the previous approach failed - the opposite of production ready.

TEXT: Sections on TypeScript, Blueprint, subtyping, narrowing
ISSUE: These extensive theoretical explorations don't inform a hurried reader about what's production ready now - they read as ongoing research.

TEXT: "I still want to plot something, so how will I do that? I'm not so gung-ho about translating JSON Schema into my JsonType, so for now, I'll just do runtime checking"
ISSUE: "for now" and choosing a workaround suggests the preferred approach isn't ready.

TEXT: "## Other potential improvements"
ISSUE: Ending with a list of future improvements rather than highlighting current production capabilities leaves the hurried reader uncertain about what's ready now.

**Structural Issue:**
The entire document is structured as a development journey rather than a status announcement. A hurried reader needs: (1) Clear statement of production readiness upfront, (2) What works well, (3) Known limitations, (4) How to use it. This text provides an exploratory narrative instead.
