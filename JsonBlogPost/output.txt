# Analysis for Lean user in a hurry evaluating `json-schema-lean`

TEXT: "I also have hope for similar schema-based subtyping to provide guarantees for dataframe libraries, SQL results, and tensor manipulation..."
ISSUE: For a user evaluating json-schema-lean for JSON validation, future hopes about unrelated applications (dataframes, SQL, tensors) wastes time and doesn't inform their decision.

TEXT: "By sharing an excessive level of detail below, I aim to encourage more people to work on libraries like `json-schema-lean`..."
ISSUE: This explicitly warns the reader they're about to encounter "excessive detail" - a user in a hurry should skip everything after this, but doesn't know what they'd miss. This undermines the text's ability to inform efficiently.

TEXT: "# Step 1: JSON Schema in Lean" through "## What doesn't work?" (entire section)
ISSUE: Implementation details about how the library was built don't inform whether it's a decent choice for validation. A user in a hurry needs capabilities and limitations, not development history.

TEXT: "## Step 1.1: URIs" through "### A slight detour: Json Pointer Fragments" (entire section)
ISSUE: Deep dive into URI implementation and RFC specs is irrelevant for evaluating whether to use json-schema-lean. This is development backstory, not user-facing information.

TEXT: "## Step 1.1.1: Testing" (entire section about building a testing library)
ISSUE: How the developer tested the library during development doesn't inform a user whether the library is suitable for their JSON validation needs.

TEXT: "# Step 2: Json Schema Code Gen" through end of section
ISSUE: This entire section is about code generation from schemas - an approach the author attempted but doesn't recommend using. For evaluating json-schema-lean as a validation library, this is a distraction.

TEXT: "# Step 3: Code Gen with Vega-Lite" - showing failures with mutual inductives, compilation times, and ugly code
ISSUE: This section demonstrates the library failing at a major use case. For a user in a hurry, this actively signals "don't use this for complex schemas" without clearly stating whether basic validation is still viable.

TEXT: "# Back to the drawing board" through "## Conclusion" (all sections on subtyping, TypeScript, blueprints, JSON difficulties, etc.)
ISSUE: This massive section describes an alternative approach the author pursued instead of using json-schema-lean, suggesting dissatisfaction with the library itself. None of this informs whether json-schema-lean is good for validation - it suggests the opposite.

TEXT: "Despite the potential, creating schemas for all of VegaLite might be more work than I'd be willing to go through for plotting, where I only need correctness for my data."
ISSUE: The conclusion suggests even the author wouldn't use their recommended approach for the motivating use case, leaving a user confused about whether json-schema-lean is actually a decent choice.

TEXT: The entire second half of the post (after the demo section)
ISSUE: A user "in a hurry" would need to read ~200 words (intro + caveats + demo) but is confronted with ~3000+ words of implementation details, failed experiments, and alternative approaches. The signal-to-noise ratio becomes extremely poor after the demo ends.
